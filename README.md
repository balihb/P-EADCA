---

## I. Ontological Position (Proto-Existentialism)

We do not know what "existence" even means. Any statement about existence is based on assumptions. Therefore, the starting point of P-EADCA is ontological uncertainty: it is not knowable whether the subject, the object, or existence itself exists in any form. This is a proto-existential position: it precedes even the existentialist axiom of "I exist."

---

## II. Epistemological Position (Agnosticism)

P-EADCA denies the possibility of certain knowledge about any absolute reality. Knowledge is always limited, and experience is always filtered, modeled, and organized into systems of constructions. Agnosticism here applies not only to the existence of God or metaphysical entities but to all ontological and epistemological claims.

---

## III. World Model (Determinism)

If existence can be assumed, then its operation is deterministic[^1]. The universe (if such exists) operates according to rules, and every event is the outcome of these rules. The probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics does not imply free will but merely describes statistically distributed deterministic processes.

---

## IV. Thinking Strategy (Constructive Abstractionism)

Since existence, reality, and knowledge cannot be grasped with absolute certainty, the purpose of thinking is not to seek ultimate truth but to construct and examine models. Thinking becomes a free playground where all hypotheses are allowed as long as they are logically coherent.

---

## V. Ethical Aspect (Responsibility Paradox)

The fact that every thought is a construction does not eliminate the relevance of responsibility. The consequences of models have real effects. Therefore, cognitive freedom does not imply ethical nihilism.

---

## VI. Mental Impact (Liberation from Dogmas)

The realization of P-EADCA is liberating: it is not bound by dogmas, belief systems, or metaphysical constraints. It allows for the pure logical development of thought without external or internal limitations.

---

## VIII. Closing Axiom

> "I may not exist. If I do, I am free to think about anything."

[^1]: The determinism referenced here refers to determinism as it manifests itself at the macro-level of physical laws and systems — not at the level of individual quantum events. While quantum mechanics introduces probabilistic outcomes at the measurement level, the governing equations (e.g., Schrödinger equation) evolve deterministically. Thus, for the purposes of this framework, determinism refers to the rule-based evolution of systems, independent of local probabilistic fluctuations.
